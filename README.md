# Tetracontrol

An arduino script for converting and displaying images on an tetrapix display.

## Notes

* "tetracontrol.ino" needs to be run on an arduino board.
* The converter requires python 3 and the PIL library to be installed.   
  Get PIL by executing this command: `python -m pip install Pillow`
* Ignore `/serial/`. It contains failed attempts at displaying images via a serial connection.

## Contributions

I don't plan to continue development on this project.
However, I will happily merge pull requests with good contributions to the master branch.
